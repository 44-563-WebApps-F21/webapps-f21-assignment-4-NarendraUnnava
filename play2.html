    <h6 class="Marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="Marchmont speech">MRS. MARCHMONT.  That is exactly what we can’t stand.  My Reginald is
        quite hopelessly faultless.  He is really unendurably so, at times!
        There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him.</p>
    <h6 class="Goring name">LORD GORING</h6><p class="Goring speech">How terrible!  Really, the thing should be more widely
        known!</p>
    <h6 class="BASILDON name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="BASILDON speech"> Basildon is quite as bad; he is as domestic as if he was
