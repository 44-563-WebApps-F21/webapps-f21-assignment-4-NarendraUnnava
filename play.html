    <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2>
    <h3>ACT I. The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square.</h3>
    <pre>
        MRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?

        LADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?
        
        MRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?
        
        LADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I
        go anywhere.
        
        MRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated.
        
        LADY BASILDON.  Ah! I hate being educated!
        
        MRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come
        here to try to find one.
        
        LADY BASILDON.  [_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]  I don’t see
        anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
        time.
        
        MRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!

        LADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?
