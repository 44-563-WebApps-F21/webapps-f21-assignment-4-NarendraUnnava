    <h2>An Ideal Husband</h2>
    <h3>ACT I. The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House in Grosvenor Square.</h3>
    <h6 class="Marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="Marchmont speech">Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>
    <h6 class="BASILDON name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="BASILDON speech"> I suppose so.  Are you?</p>
    <h6 class="Marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="Marchmont speech"> Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>
    <h6 class="BASILDON name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="BASILDON speech"> Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.</p>
    <h6 class="Marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="Marchmont speech">  I come here to be educated.</p>
    <h6 class="BASILDON name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="BASILDON speech">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>
    <h6 class="Marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="Marchmont speech">So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn’t it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come here to try to find one.</p>
    <h6 class="BASILDON name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="stage_direction">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p><p class="BASILDON Speech"> I don’t see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.</p>
    <h6 class="Marchmont name">MRS. MARCHMONT</h6><p class="Marchmont speech">How very trivial of him!</p>
    <h6 class="BASILDON name">LADY BASILDON</h6><p class="BASILDON speech">Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?</p>
